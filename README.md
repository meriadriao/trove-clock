Trove is simple to use and easy to love. Here's what you can do:

- **Track focus sessions:** the timer will start the moment you click on focus. After the set amount of minutes, a break session will begin.
- **Make a to-do list:** the first task on your list will be displayed at the top of the page. Once you're done, the next task will appear on it's place.
- **Watch your collection grow:** as you complete focus sessions, a new plant pot will be added to your shelf!
- **Choose your visual:** choose between light and dark mode. You can also trade the pixel font for a sans-serif font.
- **And more to come!**
- - Notifiers;
- - New plants;
- - Decor and trinkets - rewards for completed break sessions.

## 📚 The process
My personal objective was to create a responsive and acessible interface, utilizing my design and programming skills.

This project has the objective to reach people that are interested in the Pomodoro technique and like a minimal and cute aesthetic for their apps.

The features were defined based on market research and user interviews, seeking to meet their greatest needs and resolve common frustrations with Pomodoro apps.

The app's hierarchy is flat, with balanced, straightforward, and accessible navigation. It does have growth potential, but it's not a current goal.
